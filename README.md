# interview-fullstack-prep

## Running the Repo 

### Frontend
- run `pnpm i`
- run `pnpm dev`

### Backend
- download `firebase.json` and put file into same directory as `main.ts`
- run `pnpm i`
- run `pnpm dev`

### Extra
- FrontEnd (6 hours), Backend (2 hours)
- Used Firestore Database for fast setup, rest of tech stack was used as per requirements
- Material used was figma, stack overflow, and official dev docs from Tailwind, Firebase, and Vue

### If more time
- implement "my technologies" section
- create a C4 model abstraction section of the user flow
- implement a design system in the code that matches the design guide more closely
- include more of the component states in the figma design guide such as "loading" for logo upload
- small bugs I wasn't able to address in time (first time that user searches for a technology name the error border doesn't light up, the checkbox at the bottom doesn't match the design exactly, didn't get the text wrap to work for tech description, and a few others that I was hoping to address)
