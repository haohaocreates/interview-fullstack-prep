- Used Firestore Database for fast setup, rest of tech stack was used as per requirements
- Material used was figma, stack overflow, and official dev docs from Tailwind, Firebase, and Vue

### If more time
- implement "my technologies" section
- create a C4 model abstraction section of the user flow
- implement a design system in the code that matches the design guide more closely
- include more of the component states in the figma design guide such as "loading" for logo upload
